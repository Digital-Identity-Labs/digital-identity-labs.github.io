We've released an update to [Ishigaki](https://github.com/Digital-Identity-Labs/ishigaki), 
our rather elegant Docker image for the Shibboleth IdP.

Ishigaki now includes Jetty 9.4.20, a minor update containing lots of bugfixes.

We've also updated the base OS for the container: Ishigaki now runs on
 Debian 10 Buster, via the excellent MiniDeb from [Bitnami](https://bitnami.com/).
 
 Neither change should cause any differences in how you use Ishigaki.
