Last week I went to a local one-day conference (Manchester Digital) which I think is the first one I've attended since
the pandemic. A bit of a strain psychologically (and I managed to scald my hands and soak my trousers with hot water in the first 5 minutes)
but a good experience. Which is fortunate because I've got at least two more conferences coming up in the next few weeks. 

My old conference-attending iPad is on its last legs and getting a replacement delayed this weekly link update.

No proper Identity Management links this week, somehow.

* [Apple is plotting the death of the password](https://qz.com/apple-killing-the-password-ios-macos-1850561638) This isn't a good article - it implies that Apple's Passkeys will work with password-based sites, which isn't what replacing passwords means. Also, passwords will never die.

OTOH I've collected lots of project management themed links:

* [The Dark Side of Open Source](https://redd.one/blog/the-dark-side-of-open-source) The downsides of developing or contributing to Open Source Software
* [Finish your projects](https://github.com/readme/guides/finish-your-projects) I need to get a LOT better at finishing projects
* [Imaginary Problems Are the Root of Bad Software](https://cerebralab.com/Imaginary_Problems_Are_the_Root_of_Bad_Software) I'm convinced most of Self Soveriegn Identity movement is about solving imaginary problems
* [awesome-cto](https://github.com/kuchin/awesome-cto) Lots of CTO (Chief Technology Officer) links

* [Prioritising effectively and getting work done as managers](https://softwareleads.substack.com/p/prioritising-effectively-and-getting) Not one of my strong points

Webmentions aren't a new standard but I've been wondering if they can be used for other things (SAML-related things...)

Finally, some of the less serious things I've found
