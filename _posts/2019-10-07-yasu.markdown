Yet another patch update to [Ishigaki](https://github.com/Digital-Identity-Labs/ishigaki)! 
(The update was last week, but I forgot to post an announcement on the blog)

Ishigaki is now using [Shibboleth IdP 3.4.6](https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/IDP30/ReleaseNotes#ReleaseNotes-3.4.6(Oct2,2019)),
 a patch update that brings memory allocation bug fixes and a security fix.
  The security fix might cause problems for IdPs using custom login flow
   extensions which have been a bit cheeky about API usage.
