On Friday we released version 4.0.0 of [Ishigaki](https://github.com/Digital-Identity-Labs/ishigaki), another major
update to our Shibboleth IdP container. Ishigaki is probably the best Shibboleth IdP
base container for use with Docker, Kubernetes and other container services, and is available for both AMD64 and
ARM64 platforms. This is the first release of Ishigaki based on Shibboleth IdP v5.

This latest release contains a number of major updates:

 * [Shibboleth IdP 5.0.0 ](https://shibboleth.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDP5/pages/3199500367/ReleaseNotes#5.0.0-(Sep-13th%2C-2023))
 * [Jetty 11.0.17](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jetty-announce/msg00149.html)
 * Bitnami's minDeb OS based on [Debian 12.2](https://www.debian.org/News/2023/20231007)

As with previous major updates it will be necessary to update configuration files and [read the updated documentation for
Shibboleth IdP 5](https://shibboleth.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDP5/overview).

Ishigaki container images are available from [Github](https://github.com/Digital-Identity-Labs/ishigaki/pkgs/container/ishigaki) and
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/digitalidentity/ishigaki).


You can read about other minor changes in the [Changelog](https://github.com/Digital-Identity-Labs/ishigaki/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) on Github.
