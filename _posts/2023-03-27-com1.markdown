I used to enjoy reading a regular link blog called A Fresh Cup until the 
[author, Mike, retired it](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/jkvyjo/a_fresh_cup_is_retiring/) 
(and himself, in an non-Blade-Runnery way) a few years ago. A Fresh Cup focused on sharing interesting software
development links and was often a great source of neat projects.

Nowadays I read a lot of different mailing lists, do a lot of bookmarking, and bombard colleagues with what I think
are interesting links, so it's hopefully not going to be much more effort to post them here too, where they might
be useful to more people. Common themes will probably be Ruby, Elixir, identity management and systems administration.
Let's see how it goes - here's the first big batch of things I found last week: 

* [Wretch](https://github.com/elbywan/wretch) A friendly wrapper for Javascript's fetch (which I need, I loathe fetch)
