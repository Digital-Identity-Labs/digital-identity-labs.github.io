I had some time off last week - I went to RHS Bridgewater and failed to photograph bees, and to a big Yayoi Kusama exhibition. 
The rest of the week was apparently headaches. But I still have links!

First the Identity Management links:

* [IAMActionHunter](https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/aws/iamactionhunter-aws-iam-permissions/) I don't use AWS IAM much but I do like how this tool extracts settings and presents them in a spreadsheet for review
* [Why Identity Governance needs authorization controls](https://www.theidentityjedi.com/p/iga-needs-authz) Beyond the actual topic (not letting direct access conflict with automated, controlled changes) I find it interest that "governance" has already become a service, a technology, rather than just agreements and organisational culture. I don't like this - I think governance should exist totally outside any technical service used to apply changes.
* [app_identity](https://github.com/KineticCafe/app_identity) Another way for services to authenticate with each other (and [an Elixir implementation](https://github.com/KineticCafe/app_identity/tree/main/elixir))
* [TikTok Passkeys for Login](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/passkeys-fido-alliance) TikTok adds Passkeys. SSID/DID's fox has been absolutely machine-gunned to bits now.
* [Repel OAuth refresh token replay attacks with Elixir and Ecto](https://medium.com/@mpotra/repel-oauth-refresh-token-replay-attacks-with-elixir-and-ecto-1ac5c6d2495b) Article on preventing oauth replay attacks in Elixir (a bit too specific I know)
* [Proton Pass is open source and audited for security](https://proton.me/blog/pass-open-source-security-audit) Proton have open sourced their password manager


Last week Google attempted to sneak out a proposal to destroy the open Web by implementing a form of DRM in browsers. Nobody liked that.

* [A terrible idea explained dishonestly](https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/blob/main/explainer.md)
* [Web-Environment-Integrity/issues](https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/issues) Github issues for the proposal were locked after a crowd with flaming torches and pitchforks appeared
* [So, you don't like a web platform proposal](https://blog.yoav.ws/posts/web_platform_change_you_do_not_like/) We don't like it because it's obviously awful

The number of project management related links seems to be growing each week. Here are some more:

* [Accidentally load-bearing](https://www.jefftk.com/p/accidentally-load-bearing) Here for the mention of Chesterton's Fence
* [You can't stop the business, or why rewrites fail](https://swizec.com/blog/you-can-t-stop-the-business-or-why-rewrites-fail/) Ah, failed rewrites... 
* [Names should be as short as possible while still being clear](https://benhoyt.com/writings/short-names/) Good advice about naming functions
* [Why Do SBOM Haters Hate?](https://dfrlab.org/2023/07/19/why-do-sbom-haters-hate/) I don't hate SBOMs but I haven't made any either, so there's time
* [Why software projects take longer than you think: a statistical model](https://erikbern.com/2019/04/15/why-software-projects-take-longer-than-you-think-a-statistical-model.html) "I suspect devs are actually decent at estimating the *median* time to complete a task. Planning is hard because they suck at the *average*."
* [The unconference toolbox](https://devonzuegel.com/post/the-unconference-toolbox) I enjoyed my first unconference a few weeks ago, and this page looks like a good resource for people planning them. 

People enthusing about things:

* [DisplayPort: A Better Video Interface](https://hackaday.com/2023/07/11/displayport-a-better-video-interface/) Why DisplayPort is the best way to connect a monitor
* [2023 May Be A Year Of TOML](https://tomaszs2.medium.com/2023-may-be-a-year-of-toml-b3c5f0e37efc) Why TOML is the best config file format

Lots of software and web development links as usual:

* [sniffnet](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet) A nice TUI app that monitors network traffic. I might have linked to this before but I'm too lazy to check.
* [Event sourcing : But why?](https://medium.com/@vinciabhinav7/event-sourcing-3a1a2b75a971) an overview of Event Sourcing

* [twenty](https://github.com/twentyhq/twenty) An open source alternative to SalesForce for CRM
* [GoRead](https://github.com/TypicalAM/goread) A TUI RSS reader
* [Pop](https://github.com/charmbracelet/pop) A commandline email client - people seem to think this is a new thing, it really isn't!
* [The Case Against Ecto.Multi](https://tomkonidas.com/repo-transact/) When to not use Ecto Multi, and to just use database transactions instead
* [Timeseries with PostgreSQL](https://alexplescan.com/posts/2023/07/15/postgres-timeseries/) Maybe you don't need special plugins to do time series work with PG
* [Skiff Mail review](https://news.itsfoss.com/skiff-mail-review/) Open Source secure webmail
* [systemd vs init Controversy, A Layman's Guide](https://itsfoss.com/systemd-init/) An alternative to listening to old sysadmins grumble about SystemD

* [2023 State of the API Report](https://www.postman.com/state-of-api/api-technologies/#api-technologies) I am, frankly, shocked at how much SOAP is being used in 2023
* [Rethinking infrastructure as code from scratch](https://nathanpeck.com/rethinking-infrastructure-as-code-from-scratch/) A very interesting proposal to restructure infrastructure as code to resemble the HTML and CSS split
* [How malicious libraries can steal all your application secrets](https://www.peterullrich.com/how-malicious-libraries-can-steal-all-your-application-secrets) Not a huge risk but worth considering

Only one silly thing, but it is really quite silly:

* [minegrub-theme](https://github.com/Lxtharia/minegrub-theme) This makes GRUB boot menus (as seen on Linux PCs) look like Minecraft.
