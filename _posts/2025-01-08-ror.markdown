A new Elixir library for accessing research organization data

We've recently released [ROR](https://github.com/Digital-Identity-Labs/ror), an unofficial Elixir client for the
[Research Organization Registry (ROR)](https://ror.org) API.

```
The Research Organization Registry (ROR) includes IDs and metadata for more than 110,000 organizations and counting.
Registry data is CC0 and openly available via a search interface, REST API, and data dump. Registry updates are curated
through a community process and released at least once a month
```
If you have LiveBook installed you can try it out right now:

[![Run in Livebook](https://livebook.dev/badge/v1/blue.svg)](https://livebook.dev/run?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FDigital-Identity-Labs%2Fror%2Fmain%2Fror_notebook.livemd)

Otherwise the ROR client can be installed via [Hex.pm](https://hex.pm/packages/ror) as you'd expect.

There are already plans to use the ROR client in some open source projects ([Smee](https://github.com/Digital-Identity-Labs/smee), for a start)
and in a new commercial application we're working on. We hope to add some functions to the library over time - if you 
have any requests please let us know.

## Features

* Lookup individual ROR records by ID
* Search and Quick Search based on names or record attributes
* Paging and filters are supported
* Match text to records, possibly identifying an organisation from existing data
* Records are returned as typed structs (slightly different to the ROR JSON responses, but containing all the information)
* Client ID authentication is supported and optional
