I had lots of fun last week starting to rebuild my big old metadata processing app using the new [Smee](https://github.com/Digital-Identity-Labs/smee) libraries that were 
originally based on chunks of scrappy code copied from it. A few things don't quite line up properly, a few features are missing,
and one or two features need to be optional - other uses of Smee so far (like an MDQ app) assume slightly different data. But
overall it's working out nicely - the new app is simpler, faster and much more reliable.

Last week's interesting identity management links first, as usual:

* [kratos_plug](https://github.com/ScoreVision/kratos_plug) Use the Kratos IdP from Elixir (as an SP)
* [A long road up to Boruta](https://medium.com/@io.pascal.knoth/a-long-road-up-to-boruta-f3b9ca5a9ac9) History of the Boruta OpenIDC server project
* [Have I Been Pwned Domain Searches: The Big 5 Announcements!](https://www.troyhunt.com/have-i-been-pwned-domain-searches-the-big-5-announcements/) Improvements to Domain Monitoring in HIBP
* [What is OpenRoaming?](https://community.jisc.ac.uk/library/network-and-technology-service-docs/what-openroaming) and [eduroam + OpenRoaming](https://eduroam.org/eduroam-openroaming-end-user-information/) EduRoam is looking into linking EduRoam with OpenRoaming somehow
* [Looking Back to REFEDS 46 in Tirana](https://refeds.org/a/2933) Blog post summarising a recent meeting of REFEDS community ([slides](https://refeds.org/meetings/46th))
* [ADFSToolkit](https://github.com/fedtools/adfstoolkit) and [How to consume SWAMID metadata with ADFS Toolkit](https://wiki.sunet.se/display/SWAMID/How+to+consume+SWAMID+metadata+with+ADFS+Toolkit) It's possible to sort of brute-force ADFS into behaving as an acceptable federated IdP?
* [University multilateral federation solution design](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/multilateral-federation-introduction) Well Microsoft aren't keen and recommend proxying to or from a decent SAML IdP instead
* [Secure Sign-in Trends Report](https://www.okta.com/the-secure-sign-in-trends-report/) It's obviously marketing for Okta but still contains some useful info
* [State of browser privacy evolution](https://wiki.refeds.org/display/GROUPS/State+of+browser+privacy+evolution) and [Browser Changes and Federation](https://wiki.refeds.org/display/GROUPS/Browser+Changes+and+Federation) A working group monitoring and responding to misplaced "improvments" to web browsers that may break secure federated authentication

* [staticrypt](https://github.com/robinmoisson/staticrypt) Use Javascript to encrypt and decrypt static web pages
* [How to password protect a static HTML page with no JS](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2023/02/how-to-password-protect-a-static-html-page-with-no-js/) Or use CSS to "encrypt" instead. Please don't actually do this. Just look at this page with a horrified expression.
* [Selection results of excellent proposals in the Hwangdang Regulation Contest](https://www.opm.go.kr/opm/news/press-release.do?mode=view&articleNo=153833&article.offset=0&articleLimit=10)
    South Korea allows people to vote on laws they want to be changed, and they voted to stop forced regular password resets for government accounts. I think.

Someone asked if IRM (Identity Relationship Management) was still a thing, I didn't even know it *was* a thing, or what sort of thing it was. I can now confirm it is still a thing.

* [Identity Knowledge Graph 2023](https://www.indykite.com/identity-knowledge-graph) "A real-world data model of both person and non-person entities and the relationships between them"
* [3Edges](https://www.3edges.com/) Graphical authorisation policy builder that's aware of entity relationships
* [SGNL](https://sgnl.ai/) Also seems to use IRM principles

There's now a number of different federated SSH projects across the world, with new plans to work together. I've been 
thinking about this problem for ages so I'm logging every link I've found:

* [CryptPad](https://cryptpad.fr/slide/#/2/slide/view/Nj0AaaclHpdDwvmrKt8yZYjbXRHOJlo0pwOpBps4pNI/present/) The original presentation on this topic
* [SSH with OIDC OpenID Connect Access Tokens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=090D4s0TNaA) Video for the KIT approach

* [PAM module for OAuth 2.0 Device flow](https://github.com/stfc/pam_oauth2_device) STFC are using a PAM module and OAuth2
* [PAM module for OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant](https://github.com/ICS-MU/pam_oauth2_device) as is Masaryk University
* [SSH certs in a federated world](https://github.com/wayf-dk/ssh-certs-in-a-federated-world) WAYF are going with a SSH certificate based approach
* [PAM web login](https://wiki.surfnet.nl/display/SRAM/PAM+web+login) SURFNet are always doing something cool. PAM for them.
* [pam-weblogin](https://github.com/SURFscz/pam-weblogin) PSURFNet PAM code 
* [Web based SSH login](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jyn1FJKAIh4) DAASI have something that looks like what I was planning, but smoothly does it in one step 
* [Federated SSH login](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36g_Waxt2bY) It supports more than one IdP, of course. This is a better user experience than mine, although mine needed no extra software on the server.
