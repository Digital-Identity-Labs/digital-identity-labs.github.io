I went to Sheffield last week, which isn't that unusual in itself (lots of people go to Sheffield) but I think it
might be the first time I've left Greater Manchester in about 3 years. I went to the [UKEduCamp](https://ukeducamp.co.uk) 
unconference where I only mildly embarrassed myself and met lots of friendly smart people.
