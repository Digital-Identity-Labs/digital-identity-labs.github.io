I almost forgot to post this today - it's a Bank Holiday and I've spent the morning trying to spec a new bathroom.

Even in bathrooms technology moves on - are rimless toilets a good idea? Mirrors have Bluetooth now! I don't know what I'm doing but hopefully the people I'm 
paying do.

BlueSky Social has been the big new thing this week. They appear to have provided The Big Benefit of Self Sovereign IDs
without any of the blockchain garbage as a side-effect of making their new backend distributed and allowing users to
seamlessly change home servers.

* [First impressions of Bluesky's AT Protocol](https://educatedguesswork.org/posts/atproto-firstlook/) Complicated but promising
* [XRPC](https://atproto.com/specs/xrpc) XRPC is possibly a new rival to GraphQL for simpler data structures?

Passkeys are still a hot topic

* [Passwordless login with passkeys](https://developers.google.com/identity/passkeys) Google's docs for their Passkeys implementation
* [About the security of passkeys](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213305) Reassurance from Apple, but also details on how their implementation differs significantly from others
* [The War on Passwords Enters a Chaotic New Phase](https://www.wired.com/story/passwords-passkey-transition-time/) More diverse and inconsistent than "chaotic" I think

Shell scripting with BASH 

* [sh/shfmt](https://github.com/mvdan/sh) Bash formatter
* [ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/) Bash linter with a great name
* [Pure-sh-bible](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pure-sh-bible) A big cookbook of shell-only approaches to common problems

Identity management and authentication things

* [Biscuit 3.0](https://www.biscuitsec.org/blog/biscuit-3-0/) Biscuit is a very interesting, much richer alternative to JWTs
* [The State of Dynamic Authorization](https://www.3edges.com/the-state-of-dynamic-authorization) I'm tempted to move into this field
* [Entity authentication with a KEM](https://neilmadden.blog/2023/04/20/entity-authentication-with-a-kem/) Different authentication approach
* [Cloud Scorecard Directory](https://internet2.edu/cloud/internet2-net-plus-services/cloud-scorecard/cloud-scorecard-directory/) A nice directory of Internet2-rated services
* [Why is OAuth still hard in 2023?](https://www.nango.dev/blog/why-is-oauth-still-hard) A criticism of Oauth but also a plug for Nango, an Oauth-based data sync app. It looks useful.
* [Nango](https://github.com/NangoHQ/nango) Here's the Nango open source app
* [Boruta Docs](https://developers.boruta.patatoid.fr/docs/intro) Boruta has some great docs, I missed these last week.
