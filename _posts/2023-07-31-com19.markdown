I had some time off this week and didn't get much done when I should have, but it wasn't a bad week. Certainly not as bad
as it was for some Google staff. I've been dabbling/recoiling in horror at Javascript again. 

As always, identity management links first, although technically this week I'm including an identity management scam.

* [New cryptocurrency offers users tokens for scanning their eyeballs](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jul/25/cryptocurrency-eyeballs-worldcoin-chatgpt-openai) An irresponsibly gentle article in The Guardian about the launch of the WorldCoin scam
* [Worldcoin: a solution in search of its problem](https://open.substack.com/pub/mollywhite/p/worldcoin-a-solution-in-search-of) Molly White's appropriately ungentle summary of the WorldCoin scam.
* [Measuring the Risk Password Reuse Poses for a University](https://www.usenix.org/publications/loginonline/measuring-risk-password-reuse-poses-university) The University of Chicago has been studying their users password use for 20 years!
* [SSH TPM Agent](https://github.com/Foxboron/ssh-tpm-agent) Store SSH keys in your computer's secure TPM module

Google's clumsy attempt to sneak in web DRM is continuing to rumble on:

* [Ensure Origin Trial enables full feature ](https://github.com/chromium/chromium/commit/6f47a22906b2899412e79a2727355efa9cc8f5bd) One week it was just an unofficial suggestion, then parts of it are going into Chrome... Hmmm. 
* [Intent to Prototype: Web environment integrity API](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/Ux5h_kGO22g/m/XCAIgPtxAQAJ) Critics of Google's plan are apparently "Bullies and criminals!"

* [Apple already shipped attestation on the web, and we barely noticed](https://httptoolkit.com/blog/apple-private-access-tokens-attestation/) I'm not convinced that Apple's (and Cloudflare's) anti-spambot attestation is the same thing as Google's proposal but its worth worrying about whether it not it could *become* similar
