It seems like a good time to start blogging about Digital Identity again.
 Indiid's blog ran out of content after the launch and before the rewrite work,
  and since then most DIL work has been contract jobs for customers and NDAed.

Since we now have quite a few ongoing open source projects, a new version
of Indiid in the works and some interesting new services being developed
it would be good to write a little more about them, so the DI blog is
returning. With a bit of luck there'll be a few interesting posts here soon.
