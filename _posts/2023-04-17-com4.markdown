There was a strong Postgresql theme last week:

* [Postgres: The Graph Database You Didn't Know You Had](https://www.dylanpaulus.com/posts/postgres-is-a-graph-database/) Using Postgresql graph data
* [SQL Maxis: Why We Ditched RabbitMQ And Replaced It With A Postgres Queue](https://www.prequel.co/blog/sql-maxis-why-we-ditched-rabbitmq-and-replaced-it-with-a-postgres-queue) RabbitMQ is great but it does seem to be overkill for simpler apps.
* [Announcing FerretDB 1.0 GA - a truly Open Source MongoDB alternative](https://blog.ferretdb.io/ferretdb-1-0-ga-opensource-mongodb-alternative/) I didn't like MongoDB, but much of that was due to the dev culture and decisions - maybe I'll like this clone?
* [Setting Up PostgreSQL Failover and Failback, the Right Way!](https://www.highgo.ca/2023/04/10/setting-up-postgresql-failover-and-failback-the-right-way/) I'm very out of date on PG clustering and replication
* [PostgreSQL: credcheck](https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/credcheck-v10-released-2619/) Extensions to manage passwords for PG users
* [PL/Rust Just Shipped: Easy Way to Try It Out](https://yrashk.com/blog/2023/04/05/plrust-just-shipped-easy-way-to-try-it-out/) Try the new Rust add-on for PG
* [PostgreSQL: Documentation: 15: MERGE](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-merge.html) I had no idea MERGE existed
* [merge_into_polyfill](https://github.com/ZennerIoT/merge_into_polyfill) Adding PG MERGE to Ecto
* [Supavisor](https://github.com/supabase/supavisor) Another useful PG connection pooler, but written in Elixir!

Webassembly (WASM) seems to be maturing enough to be very useful now, but last week I found saying "WASM" in public was
  embarrassing. 

* [Wasm, WASI, Wagi: What are they?](https://www.fermyon.com/blog/wasm-wasi-wagi) They are all embarrassing to say
* [Announcing WCGI: WebAssembly + CGI](https://wasmer.io/posts/announcing-wcgi) CGI is back!
* [WAPM - WebAssembly Package Manager](https://wapm.dev/) A WASM package manager

* [Speaking Primal](http://speakingprimal.blogspot.com/) I was surprised to start playing Far Cry Primal and realise the invented language is properly constructed, and has speakers
* [Ky](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ky) Another enhancement/replacement for Javascript's horrible Fetch
* [CrabLang](https://crablang.org/) Rust has been forked, I don't know why.
