I managed to release a couple of things as open source last week and start a couple more, and the old, messy app that
Smee is based on is now being rewritten with it. So far the rewrite has definitely paid off. 

The Apple Vision Pro looks amazing, I want one, but I have nothing much to add to the excitement except to note that that
its built-in authentication (eye scanning) is rather interesting.

Identity management things first:

* [FastFed Working Group - OpenID Foundation](https://openid.net/wg/fastfed/) I was vaguely aware of FastFed for OpenID 
* [FastFed Basic SAML Profile 1.0 - draft 02](https://openid.net/specs/fastfed-saml-1_0-02.html) but not that it could work with SAML!
* [SESSIONS - TNC23](https://tnc23.geant.org/sessions/#s272) Videos of sessions at TNC, some of which are identity and OSS related. Also [REFEDs Meeting](https://refeds.org/meetings/46th)
* [Open Source Principles for NRENs](https://wiki.geant.org/display/GREEN/Open+Source+Principles+for+NRENs) Geant is building a principles/BP doc for NRENs working with open source
* [Netflix's password-sharing crackdowns prompts an increase in subscriptions](https://qz.com/netflix-password-sharing-crackdown-more-subscriptions-1850522985) Better authentication, more income
* [regal](https://github.com/StyraInc/regal) A linter for the Rego authorisation language
* [Managing risks in Internationalisation](https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/what-we-do/policy-and-research/publications/managing-risks-internationalisation) Potential security risks from offering courses to international students

A bunch of Rust links this week:

* [single-file packages ("cargo script") integration](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3424) Proposal to have Elixir-like self contained scripts in Rust
* [The Rust I Wanted Had No Future](https://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/307291.html) More commentary on the direction of Rust
