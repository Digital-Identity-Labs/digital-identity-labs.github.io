(Apologies, it's taken me weeks to actually *publish* this)

Identity management first, and this week Microsoft has been behaving badly with regards to Azure ADFS security (or whatever else it's called now)

* [After Identity](https://blog.symops.com/2023/07/21/after-identity/) Rather sprawling article on Okta, the identity Saas market, and the role of identity management in general
* [Personal Information Removal Service](https://incogni.com/deal/?transaction_id=102e09cc6f1b55fdd55f28b2802796) A service that removes your personal info from data brokers, for a price. This is the free market alternative to GDPR I suppose.
* [Kanidm](https://github.com/kanidm/kanidm) An off-the-shelf open source, Rust-based IdP
* [Compromised Microsoft Key: More Impactful Than We Thought ](https://www.wiz.io/blog/storm-0558-compromised-microsoft-key-enables-authentication-of-countless-micr) MS leak critical keys, log things badly, respond badly.
* [Guarding the bridge: new attack vectors in azure ad connect](https://blog.sygnia.co/guarding-the-bridge-new-attack-vectors-in-azure-ad-connect) Other security problems with Azure ADFS, this time it's Password Hash Sync

* [Senator Wyden's Letter](https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/wyden_letter_to_cisa_doj_ftc_re_2023_microsoft_breach.pdf) Senator Wyden's letter to various US agencies complaining about MS's poor response to recent security problems
* [Microsoft… The Truth Is Even Worse Than You Think](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/microsoftthe-truth-even-worse-than-you-think-amit-yoran/) A summary of the recent problems with Microsoft's authentication services
* [2024 List of Identity and Related Conferences](https://github.com/fedidcg/meetings/wiki/2024-List-of-Identity-and-Related-Conferences) A (growing) list of identity management conferences next year
* [Authorization – the Next Big Thing](https://idpro.org/authorization-the-next-big-thing/) Why is Authorization the Next Big Thing? My opinion is that the *technical* aspects of authentication are now solved, or at least, solved *enough*. Authorisation on the other hand is not adequately solved.
* [Sam Altman's Worldcoin might unleash worse problems than those it's trying to solve](https://qz.com/worldcoin-iris-scan-sam-altman-kenya-crypto-m-pesa-1850670272) Quartz article on the WorldCoin scam
