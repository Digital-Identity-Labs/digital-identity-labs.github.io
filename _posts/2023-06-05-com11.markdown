I feel like I've had a productive week, but trying to finish existing projects has overlapped with fascinating new things
 that I don't have time to look at yet. With a bit of luck one of those projects will have a release announcement just
to the left of this very soon.

Identity management things first:

* [Unlock 1Password with SSO using OpenID Connect](https://support.1password.com/cs/sso-configure-generic/) 1Password's SSO feature now works with generic OpenID Connect
* [Email addresses are not primary user identities](https://ntietz.com/blog/email-address-not-identifier/) Problems with using email addresses as user names
* [I still don’t really get “hash shucking”](https://neilmadden.blog/2023/04/27/i-still-dont-really-get-hash-shucking/) Hash "shucking" is new to me too
* [eID Easy](https://eideasy.com/) Offers an OAuth2 bridge to national ID services
* [RFC 9399](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9399) RFC proposal for embedding logos and avatars in x509 certificates!
* [Safari allows to configure password autofilling](https://www.stefanjudis.com/today-i-learned/safari-allows-to-configure-password-autofilling/) Harm reduction I suppose
* [Please don't use GPT for Security Guidance](https://decodebytes.substack.com/p/please-dont-use-gpt-for-security) The stochastic parrots don't understand risk. Or anything really.

I've seen so many apparently good IAM products and protocols fail that I now tend to limit my enthusiasm for new things until people are actually
  using them. Verifiable Credentials seems to be passing over the line from neat idea to practical tool (I'm not counting any of their
  use by "crypto" and Web3 scams, for obvious reasons). The general idea is that rather than sign an entire assertion containing many attributes, 
attributes are signed individually, and confusingly referred to as "credentials" which to most of us means authentication values, not user data.

* [Verifiable credentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_credentials) Wikipedia's summary
* [OpenID for Verifiable Credentials](https://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2022/06/OIDF-Whitepaper_OpenID-for-Verifiable-Credentials-V2_2022-06-23.pdf) Combining VCs with OpenID Connect seems viable
* [verifiable credentials implementations](https://github.com/w3c/verifiable-credentials/blob/main/implementations.md) I'm trying to avoid any library written for Web3
* [Verifiable Credentials Data Model v1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) This would all be nicer in XML you know
* [vc](https://rubygems.org/gems/vc) A Ruby gem package for Verifiable Credentials but the source code has vanished
* [vc](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/vc) A Javascript package for Verifiable Credentials
* [Let’s (actually) Share Our Verifiable Credentials](https://medium.com/workday-engineering/lets-actually-share-our-verifiable-credentials-7ab1b4c73079) "A specification profile outlines the way in which multiple parties agree to implement a given set of specifications"
* [UK digital identity and attributes trust framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework-beta-version) UK Gov is trying the federated ID thing again, this time with OpenID Connect and VCs. The tech, however, was never the problem.

Shocking but not surprising news that naive web developers have implemented almost worst-case privacy leaks by using Facebook
  integration. Never integrate with Facebook if you value privacy. Management however need a serious kick up the arse - 
 it's understandable that young web developers make mistakes, it's not acceptable that NHS security audits missed this.

* [NHS data breach: trusts shared patient details with Facebook without consent](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/27/nhs-data-breach-trusts-shared-patient-details-with-facebook-meta-without-consent) NHS should have caught this
* [UK mental health charities handed sensitive data to Facebook for targeted ads](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/03/uk-mental-health-charities-handed-sensitive-data-to-facebook-for-targeted-ads) but I've got a little more sympathy for charities missing it
