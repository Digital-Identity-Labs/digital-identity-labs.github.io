There's a thin line between research and procrastination. Or maybe a big grey area. Anyway, erm, lots of links this week.

First, identity management:

* [European Digital Identity Wallets: Commission publishes first technical Toolbox towards prototypes](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/european-digital-identity-wallets-commission-publishes-first-technical-toolbox-towards-prototypes) I still believe this is a dead end, but maybe I'm wrong.
* [Avoiding an Identity Crisis: An Identity and Access Management Competency Model](https://www.proquest.com/docview/2811391554) PhD paper by ID Pro member Ken Myers
* [Loud Men Talking Loudly](https://www.criticalinfralab.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/LoudMen-CorinneCath-CriticalInfraLab.pdf) IETF is the case study but this phenomena is still the norm
* [Awesome IAM](https://github.com/kdeldycke/awesome-iam) Not quite the Awesome List I was after (it's mostly principles, policy and practices) but still awesome
* [Hackers stole passwords of Worldcoin Orb operators](https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/12/hackers-stole-passwords-of-worldcoin-orb-operators) The "crypto" world's incompetence continues
* [Aliaste sulgemine](https://www.eesti.ee/et/aliaste-sulgemine/aliaste-sulgemine) Estonia is no longer going to give all citizens an email alias address, which is sad - but apparently they weren't being used.

Amazon is open-sourcing its Cedar ACL policy language. There are already existing, well established alternatives (Permify and Ory spring to mind)
  but Amazon's market dominance and use of Cedar for its own services make this A Big Deal - knowing how to use Cedar is going to
 be a key skill for cloud engineers. It's also rather impressive.

* [Cedar Language](https://www.cedarpolicy.com/en) All about the Cedar policy language 
* [edar-agent](https://github.com/permitio/cedar-agent) An open source service that uses Cedar
* [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) Or you could use Rego instead
* [Opal](https://github.com/permitio/opal) or Cedar *and* Rego
* [Opal-fetcher-Postgres](https://github.com/permitio/opal-fetcher-postgres) and store policies in Postgresql
* [Permify](https://github.com/Permify/permify) Or of course Permify/Zanzibar is already around
* [Ory](https://www.ory.sh/what-is-the-ory-permission-language/) or Ory

I'm considering starting my own Awesome list on IAM tech (skewed towards federation and HE)

* [The Awesome Side of GitHub - Awesome Lists](https://dev.to/this-is-learning/the-awesome-side-of-github-awesome-lists-2a5h)
* [Awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) an awesome list of awesome lists
* [Generator](https://github.com/dar5hak/generator-awesome-list) this seems completely unnecessary
* [The awesome manifesto](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/awesome.md) but this doesn't

I *almost* used Crystal for something useful last week but it lacked a library ("shard") to do something I can't write myself.
 This is a shame - it looks like a great language and the standard library looks very good - it even has good XML support built in. 
 But sadly not XMLSec. 

* [ðŸ’ŽCrystal the language for humansðŸ’Ž - by Diego Crespo](https://www.deusinmachina.net/p/a-look-at-the-crystal-programming)
* [Shardbox: A shards database](https://shardbox.org/)

The microservices vs monoliths debate continues. I actually tend to write backend services that are neither microservices or monoliths, just
  old fashioned middleware services.

* [Monoliths are not dinosaurs](https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2023/05/monoliths-are-not-dinosaurs.html)
* [RabbitMQ in Microservice Architecture](https://medium.com/codex/rabbitmq-in-microservice-architecture-86704b27a269)
* [Monolith vs Microservices: With Elixir You Don't Need to Choose](https://lakret.net/blog/2023-05-08-elixir-vs-microservices)
* [Implementing and Designing Microservices](https://redis.com/blog/implementing-designing-microservices/)

I am looking for a static website builder, and Bridgetown looks good:

* [Bridgetown](https://www.bridgetownrb.com/) Looks nicer than Jekyll
* [Bridgetown Cards](https://bridgetown.cards/) I like this hint sharing site too
* [Let's make a blog with Bridgetown](https://hanamimastery.com/episodes/44-bridgetown) Bridgetown tutoral
