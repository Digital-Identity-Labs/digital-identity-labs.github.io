This week I mostly learned that if you use macros and other tricks to quickly and easily create a very large library of modules and
  functions, you'll reach a point where you realise there's no way to avoid the enormous amount of documentation and tests
  you now need. But I also found these interesting links.

Identity management links first: the theme is once again Passkeys.

* [Passkey - GN5-1 WP5](https://wiki.geant.org/display/GWP5/Passkey?preview=/589070371/633276338/Introduction%20to%20Passkeys%20Usage%20and%20Implementation.pdf) "Introduction to Passkeys Usage and Implementation" presentation (via Geant)
* [Passkeys.org](https://passkey.org/) An absolutely superb passkey demonstration/test page
* [Spotlight on: Passkeys](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=mgdnfp8w) Apple article on Passkeys from last week
* [Understanding Passkeys](https://michal.sapka.me/2023/passkeys/) A clear technical overview of Passkeys
* [Passage](https://passage.1password.com/) 1Password have two new Passkey authenticator products
* [Passkey Complete](https://passage.1password.com/product/passkey-complete) 1Password's Passkey IdP (JWT only, no SAML or OIDC)
* [Passkey Flex](https://passage.1password.com/product/passkey-flex) 1Password's Passkey auth add-on for integrating with other IdPs
* [How to implement passkeys with form autofill in a web app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qSCYiU_Yr4) A Google tutorial
* [Features – privacyID3A](https://www.privacyidea.org/about/features/) A few projects are basing their Passkey implementations using privacyID3A as a backend. I'm not sure about it.
* [Examples of Dark Patterns in Privacy](https://luiza.medium.com/examples-of-dark-patterns-in-privacy-3c2baa865378) Anti-privacy tricks
* [Kenny Log-Ins](https://www.kennylog-in.com/) *groan* NO

I was wondering if these Cup Of Matcha blog posts would work as a mailing list

* [TinyLetter, smaller images](https://www.jscarlton.net/tinyletter-smaller-images/) Mailchimp's free service doesn't support Markdown or image processing, so this scripts tries to fix that
* [ButtonDown](https://buttondown.email) A commercial alternative to TinyLetter

Systems administration things
