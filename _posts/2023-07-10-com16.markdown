A busy and somewhat stressful week with more surprise consulting work than I'm used to, and unpleasantly muggy weather -
both may be to blame for the much shorter list of interesting links this week. Or, maybe there were just fewer interesting things.

I got round to trying to link a small Java app with Elixir using Erlang's RPC - it looks as if it can manage a million 
requests per second on my laptop if I add some concurrency to the Java side. I also tried to use OpenSAML as part of this
experiment, and failed. 

Identity management of course is always interesting:

* [OpenID Connect Federation 1.0](https://darutk.medium.com/oidc-federation-c2840622dc8f) An overview of OpenID Connect's new federation standard, with lots of diagrams.
* [The Big OpenSAML Guide](https://blog.samlsecurity.com/p/opensaml.html) Positive: friendly docs for using the OpenSAML library. Negative: I can't get the examples to work

With Evernote behaving as if it's "Musked" - firing staff and doubling fees - it's time to move elsewhere

* [Evernote2MD](https://github.com/wormi4ok/evernote2md) Converts Evernote notebooks to folders of Markdown text (I've not used it yet!)
* [How to switch from Evernote to Obsidian](https://nesslabs.com/evernote-to-obsidian) Obsidian looks promising as an alternative
* [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) But of course so does Joplin (I have relatives in Joplin - the city - so the name seems a bit weird)

I spent an evening trying to decode the Bluesky firehose feed, for fun.  I got a bit lost trying to decode unusual CBOR records.

* [skyfall](https://github.com/mackuba/skyfall) Stream data from the Bluesky firehose, using Ruby. This works! Unlike my effort.
* [blue_factory](https://github.com/mackuba/blue_factory) Build Bluesky feeds using Ruby

And some general software development things:

* [typeid](https://github.com/jetpack-io/typeid?utm_source=programmingdigest&utm_medium&utm_campaign=1672) TypeIDs for Elixir (UUID7, encoded to be shorter, with a prefix)
* [erldash](https://github.com/sile/erldash) A TUI dashboard showing Erlang or Elixir node info, written in Rust!
* [Type system updates](https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2023/06/22/type-system-updates-research-dev/) Elixir seems to be getting a proper type system. ** Marge Simpson HMMMMM noise **
* [Top UK universities agree on principles for using generative "AI"](https://qz.com/russel-uk-universities-generative-ai-students-1850603771)  ** Much louder Marge Simpson HMMMMM noise **
* [Skeeter](https://skeeter.streamlit.app) Twitter/Mastodon to Bluesky user search
